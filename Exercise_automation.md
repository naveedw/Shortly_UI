## Automation - Shortly - SignUp

## Goal
* Demonstrate your skill at coding automation frameworks for use
by other engineers.
* Demonstrate your ability to advise others on writing valuable
automated tests.

## Task
* The same team who asked for your help in exploratory testing has approached you again. As they are inexperienced with writing
automated tests, they have requested your assistance to get them
started on the same feature.
* To help them, write some example automated tests to verify a
candidate can upload their curriculum vitae (CV) in the Profile page and the data captured is used to pre-fill some fields on the Experience and Skills page.

## Details
* Use any testing framework you are comfortable with, explaining
your choice.
* The majority of our engineering is done in TypeScript, this is
preferred, but not a requirement.

## Submitting your results
Once youâ€™ve written your tests, run them successfully and are happy with the result:
* Document any test prerequisites, assumptions made and any
issues found a README file.
* Push your files up to a GitHub repository and share your
repository with us. Alternatively email us a Zip file with all
required files
